IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
Introduction
The goal of this task is to create a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. In this poster, we will explore the process of building a machine learning model for iris flower classification and highlight some of the key techniques used.

Dataset
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.

Machine Learning Approach
To create a model for iris flower classification, we will use a supervised learning approach. Specifically, we will use a classification algorithm called logistic regression. Logistic regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm that is often used for binary classification problems.

Data Preprocessing
Before we can train our model, we need to preprocess the dataset. This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, scaling the features, and encoding the labels. Scaling the features is important because it ensures that each feature is on a similar scale, which can improve the performance of the model. Encoding the labels is necessary because machine learning algorithms require numerical labels.

Training the Model
Once the dataset has been preprocessed, we can train the logistic regression model. During training, the model will learn to map the input features to the correct output labels. We will use a technique called gradient descent to optimize the model parameters and minimize the loss function.

Evaluation of the Model
After training the model, we need to evaluate its performance on the testing set. We will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics will help us determine how well the model is performing and identify areas where it can be improved.
