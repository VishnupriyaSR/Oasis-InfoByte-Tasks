# Introduction

With the automotive market’s continuous growth and the diversity of inuencing factors such as make, model, fuel eiciency, and additional features, accurate car price prediction becomes essential for a wide range of stakeholders. 

This research emphasizes the importance of comprehensive data collection and preprocessing, utilizing a dataset enriched with a broad spectrum of vehicle attributes.

# Conclusions

The preprocessing task was  automated using a python script designed to cleanse and organize the raw data into a usable format. 

This script facilitated the removal of incomplete records and standardized the remaining data into a CSV file format, suitable for import into Mathlab, a popular software suite for machine learning model development. 

This step was critical in preparing the dataset for the subsequent application of machine learning algorithms, ensuring that the input data was of high quality and well-suited for predictive analysis.

In  this study,  we  examined  the eectiveness  of  employing  a single  machine  learning  classifier approach,  similar  to  prior  research.  However,  our  approach  diverged  by  testing  a  dierent  set  of classifiers and adjusting the data split to better validate our models. The dataset amassed for this study was divided into two subsets: training (70%) and testing (30%). 

We constructed models using Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, and, notably, focused on enhancing the Random Forest classifier for our primary analysis.

Random Forest, also known as random decision forest, is an ensemble learning method ideally suited for both classification and regression challenges.
