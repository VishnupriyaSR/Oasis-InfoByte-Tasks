# Introduction

In this project Store Sales Prediction using machine learning and python, the task is to predict the sales of different stores based on the attributes available in the dataset. 
Predictive analytics can help us to study and discover the factors that determine the number of sales that a retail store will have in the future by using different machine learning techniques and trying to determine the best algorithm suited to our particular problem statement. 

# Challenges:

Variable Impact of Advertising: Understanding how different levels of advertising expenditure influence sales is a complex challenge.

Audience Segmentation: Identifying and analyzing the diverse audience segments to predict their impact on sales.

Platform Optimization: Determining the optimal advertising platforms for maximizing sales outcomes.

# Insights and Observations

1. Positive Correlation with TV and Radio: Sales are positively correlated with both TV and Radio advertising expenses. This indicates that increases in advertising spend on these channels are associated with higher sales. It suggests that investing in TV and Radio advertising can effectively boost sales.
Strong Correlation between TV Advertising and Sales:

2.High Impact of TV Advertising: The strong correlation between TV advertising expenses and sales highlights TV advertising as a particularly influential channel. This implies that TV ads have a significant impact on driving sales compared to other channels.
R² Score Evaluation:

3.Model Accuracy: The R² score, a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual sales data, showcased the model's accuracy. A high R² score indicates that the model explains a substantial portion of the variance in sales, making it a reliable predictor.
Model Performance:

4.Machine Learning Mpdel: The Linear Regression Model achieved impressive accuracy with 99% on training data and 98% on testing data. This indicates that the model is highly effective and generalizes well to new, unseen data.
